## Description

I started this hobby project about 1-2 years ago, but the mods are changed very often. Finally decided to make this a little bit bigger with more consistency. The modpack aims to stay close to the vanilla quality but with extras.

## Modlist

The modlist can be found here: [MODLIST.md](MODLIST.md)
